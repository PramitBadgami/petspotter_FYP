<p>Welcome to PetSpotter, your trusted platform for pet adoption. By using our website, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions of use. Please review these terms carefully before proceeding with pet adoption.</p>
<p>At PetSpotter, we strive to ensure a smooth and transparent pet adoption process. To adopt a pet from our platform, users are required to provide certain personal documents for verification before proceeding with the adoption process. These documents may include identification proofs, proof of residence, and other relevant documents as deemed necessary by our team.</p>
<p>Once the initial documentation is provided, our representatives will conduct a thorough verification process. This may include visiting the prospective adopter's place to ensure a suitable environment for the pet. This step is crucial to ensure the well-being and safety of the adopted pet.</p>
<p>Items added to the Cart will be automatically removed once the user logs out of the system. To save your favorite products for future reference, we recommend adding them to your Wishlist. This feature allows you to keep track of potential pet adoptions and make informed decisions at your convenience.</p>

<p>Before initiating the adoption process, users must ensure they meet the eligibility criteria set forth by PetSpotter. This includes being of legal age to adopt a pet and demonstrating the ability to provide a safe and nurturing environment for the animal.</p>
<p>PetSpotter is committed to ensuring the health and welfare of all pets available for adoption. However, users acknowledge that the health and behavior of adopted pets may vary, and PetSpotter cannot guarantee the long-term health or behavior of any adopted animal. It is the responsibility of the adopter to provide proper care, nutrition, and veterinary treatment for their adopted pet.</p>
<p>Upon successful completion of the adoption process, users will be required to sign an adoption agreement outlining their responsibilities as pet owners. This agreement may include terms related to pet care, behavior management, and adherence to local laws and regulations pertaining to pet ownership.</p>
<p>By proceeding with the pet adoption process on PetSpotter, you acknowledge and agree to abide by these terms and conditions. Our primary goal is to facilitate responsible pet adoption and ensure the welfare of all animals in our care. If you have any questions or concerns regarding these terms, please feel free to contact us for clarification. Thank you for choosing PetSpotter as your trusted partner in pet adoption.</p>
<p>In the event that an adopted pet cannot be cared for or experiences behavioral issues beyond the adopter's control, PetSpotter may offer a pet return policy. This policy allows adopters to return the pet to PetSpotter's care, subject to certain conditions and requirements outlined in the adoption agreement.</p>
